## One step

	One step is an application to provide the convinience for salarymen who are busy with working but prefer to cook themselves. With the help of one step, you only need one click to order the dish and receive the ingrediants at any time you want.
	
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
  * Node v5 IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME! 
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Ruby - [Download & Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Sass - You're going to use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to compile CSS during your grunt task. Make sure you have ruby installed, and then install Sass using gem install:

```bash
$ gem install sass
```

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Gulp - (Optional) You may use Gulp for Live Reload, Linting, and SASS or LESS.

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get MEAN.js is to use git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JavaScriptAcademy/oneStep.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the one step repository to a **oneStep** folder.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application. To learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. 


### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true grunt
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true grunt prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.
